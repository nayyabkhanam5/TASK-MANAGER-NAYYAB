# Kanban Task Manager

A fully featured Kanban-style task management board built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Tasks are saved in localStorage so everything persists across page reloads. No frameworks, no libraries — just clean vanilla code.

## Data Structure

Each task is stored as a JavaScript object inside an array in localStorage:

```javascript
const tasks = [
  {
    id: 1703001234567,        // Date.now() at creation time
    title: "Build login page", // Task title (min 3 chars)
    description: "Create a responsive login form with validation",
    priority: "High",          // "High" | "Medium" | "Low"
    status: "todo",            // "todo" | "progress" | "done"
    date: "2025-12-25",        // ISO date string YYYY-MM-DD
    tags: ["HTML", "CSS", "JS"], // Array of tag strings
    createdAt: 1703001234567   // Date.now() at creation time
  }
];

// Saving to localStorage:
localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(tasks));

// Reading from localStorage:
const tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("tasks")) || [];
```

## What I Learned

Building this project was a great learning experience. The biggest challenge I faced was managing the tasks array as the single source of truth — every render, filter, sort, and stat had to come from the same array instead of reading from the DOM. I also learned how localStorage works with JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to save and restore complex data. Dark mode without a page flash was tricky — I solved it by running a tiny script in the head before the body renders. The filter, search, and sort system taught me how to chain .filter() and .sort() together cleanly. Overall this project made me much more confident with DOM manipulation, event handling, and organising JavaScript into separate files with clear responsibilities.
